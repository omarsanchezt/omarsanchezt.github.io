                  <h4>Nihilistic Easyrider "DELUXE EDITION"</h4>
                  <p class="description">Nihilistic Easyrider is the brainchild of Narrow Head frontman Jacob Duarte—but make no mistake, he’s not going solo. DELUXE EDITION is a mixtape of sorts, a collection of songs written at various intervals throughout Duarte’s career. These songs traverse a wide-range of stylistic references, from saccharine Y2K emo and young-dumb-and-full-of pop punk to Soviet fuzz fueled alt and pure Evan Dando-core verse-chorus-verse-chorus-done pop rock.</p>

Co-produced with Chisel's Ted Leo, Malady's dozen songs mix handclaps and heartbreak in equal measure, all remastered and finally available on wax for the first time ever. You can toss that picture disc in the garbage now.</p>
